# 🛍️ Magento 2 Automation Testing Project (Selenium Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involved **Selenium-based automation testing** of a **Magento 2 demo store**.  
The goal was to automate critical e-commerce workflows such as login, product search, product detail verification, adding to cart, and cart validation, all within a **single browser session** to optimize test execution.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate end-to-end user workflows on Magento 2 demo store.  
- Validate product search, selection, and cart functionalities.  
- Ensure correct data and workflow validation without redundant browser sessions.  
- Generate execution logs for verification of automation results.

## 🔍 Testing Approach
- **Types of Testing Performed:**
  - Functional Automation Testing
  - Regression Testing
  - UI/UX Validation
  - Positive & Negative Test Scenarios
  - End-to-End Workflow Automation

- **Tools & Libraries Used:**
  - **Selenium WebDriver (Python)** – Browser automation  
  - **PyTest / Unittest** – Test framework for execution and reporting  
  - **Chrome / Firefox** – Cross-browser testing  
  - **Python** – Automation scripting  

## ✅ Modules / Functionalities Automated
1. **User Login** – Automate login with valid credentials.  
2. **Product Search & Filter** – Search products by name and apply filters.  
3. **Product Detail Page** – Verify product information, images, and options (size/color).  
4. **Add to Cart** – Add product(s) to cart and validate cart details.  
5. **Cart Validation** – Verify product quantity, price, and total.  
6. **Single Browser Session Execution** – All steps executed in the same session to optimize runtime and session consistency.

| Product Detail Page       | Open product and verify details                      | Product info and options displayed correctly |
| Add to Cart               | Add product to cart                                  | Product added and cart updated |
| Cart Validation           | Validate quantity, price, and total                 | Cart reflects correct data |

## 🚀 Outcome
- Automated key Magento 2 store workflows end-to-end.  
- Improved efficiency by using **single browser session execution**.  
- Reduced manual testing effort and ensured accurate workflow validation.  
- Provided logs and reports for verification of all automated test cases.
